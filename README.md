# Describe a set of data that could be important to someone, (Maybe the set of quarter mile times for a group of racers in a group of cars or lines of code from programmers)

How long ambulances take to get to the scene, or maybe how many people voted for either party, or earthquakes by magnitude

# Describe a sequence of steps to find a useful piece of information in that data set, (Maybe find the best times for individual racers (were they all using the same car))

Well for something time related we could sort the data set and then find the fastest time as well as the frequency of that time. Can also find the average of all times, as well as percentiles of the times.

# Discuss ways that grouping or ordering your data might help you find certain items or categories of data, (Maybe find the best times for each car grouped by make or model)

Sorting the data will help you find the median, and grouping data such as frequency would help with finding the mode. Sorting would also help with finding the percentiles.
